# Hey there, I'm Eden. ðŸ‘‹
I'm an ametour dev from Poland. I usually make random projects in Python.

Currently, I'm trying to learn Geometry Dash modding through Geode and just C++ in general.

You can reach out to me on Discord (TheRealEdenGD), or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/edengd.bsky.social).
